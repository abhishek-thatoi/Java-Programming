JAVA KEY POINTS


Patience is the key:
Learning Java will be overwhelming because of the volume of material about the language but be patient, 
learn at your own pace, don’t rush. Mastering Java is a process that takes time. 
And remember even the best coders would have started at some point. So it’s not a big deal, 
just do as much as you can and keep going. Give it your time. Patience is the key to success.

                                                -:BASIC ELEMENTS OF JAVA:-

JDK: JAVA develeopment kit, it consists of tools and kits that do the 
        **debugging and compiling part**

JRE: Java Runtime Environment, which internally uses JVM(java virtual machine):which does the execution part.
        JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that **provides an environment to only run(not develop)the java program(or application)on your machine.**

        JRE is only used by those who only want to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. 
        Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and **JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line,**
        hence it is also known as an interpreter.

        // Java applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere).
        At compile time, java file is compiled by Java Compiler (It
        does not interact with OS) and converts the java code into
        bytecode.    

JAVAC: its the compiler(a part of JDK). When we create a java file (eg.first.java) javac creates a class file called first.class.
       Then 'Java first' is executed by JVM(belongs to JRE).

{JIT Compiler(Just In Time Compiler): JVM compiles complete byte code to machine code.	JIT compiles only the reusable byte code to machine code.
                                      In order to improve performance, JIT compilers interact with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) at run time and
                                      compile suitable bytecode sequences into native machine code.}



                                                -:RUNNING JAVA FILE:-
A static method, means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, JUST the JVM does it.
