Execution of Servlets basically involves six basic steps: 

The clients send the request to the webserver.
The web server receives the request.
The web server passes the request to the corresponding servlet.
The servlet processes the request and generates the response in the form of output.
The servlet sends the response back to the webserver.
The web server sends the response back to the client and the client browser displays it on the screen.
